title: "Making Networks Flexible"

Think about how we build things. In the old days of IT, setting up a server was like building a detailed model airplane.
Every piece had a specific part number and a precise spot where it had to be glued. The network card was `eth0`,
and it was *always* `eth0`. If that changed, things broke.

Today, in the world of Kubernetes and the cloud, we build things more like we're using Lego bricks.
We have a big box of resources—CPU, memory, and networking and we snap them together to build what we need,
when we need it. When we're done, we take it apart and throw the bricks back in the box for the next project.

DraNet brings this flexible, "Lego-like" approach to computer networking.
It challenges the old idea that a network card is a fixed, permanent part of a machine.
Instead, it treats them as a flexible pool of resources you can use, return, and reuse.
It is a way of working that’s essential for modern applications. Let’s break down why.

## Surprise, network card names are not forever

When Kubernetes runs an application in a container, it gives that container its own private "network namespace"
to keep it isolated from everything else.
If that app needs a real, physical network card for high performance, DraNet moves the card from the main host
machine into the container’s network namespace.

Here’s the twist: when the application finishes and the container goes away, the network card is moved back to the host.
But what if another card or virtual interface with the same name already exists? To prevent a conflict,
Linux will automatically rename the card it just got back, maybe to something generic like `dev7`, for more technical
details see [Linux Network Namespaces and Interfaces](./linux-network-interfaces.md)


## A Network Is More Than Just a Card

This brings us to an even bigger idea: a "network" is much more than just the physical card you can hold in your hand.
It's an abstract concept. The real value isn’t in the card itself, but in its configuration and, most importantly, what it's connected to.

By breaking the hardcoded link between a physical card and a single, static destination, we open up a world of new possibilities.
Imagine your application could tell the wider network what it needs on the fly. It could send a signal to a router and say,
"For this next task, I need an ultra-secure, high-speed private circuit to a database in another country."
The network, using advanced technologies like SRv6 or MPLS, could instantly create that special circuit.
From your server's point of view, it’s still using the same physical network card. But for your application,
it just switched from driving on a public road to having its own private express tunnel. It's a brand-new network, tailored exactly to its needs.

This is the paradigm shift that moves networking from a legacy, static system into the true cloud-native era.
It’s about creating a dynamic, programmable environment where the network responds to the needs of the application,
not the other way around.

## Networking for the Way We Build Today

DraNet’s approach of treating network cards like flexible, interchangeable Lego bricks it's a direct response
to the dynamic nature of modern software and the realities of how cloud native sysmte works. By doing so,
it makes our systems more resilient, far more efficient, and opens the door to a future where our networks are
as dynamic and intelligent as the applications they connect.
