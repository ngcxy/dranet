This provides crucial insights into the readiness and configuration of the network interface from a Kubernetes perspective, adhering to the standardized device status defined in KEP-4817.
After a ResourceClaim is processed and a network device is allocated, its status is reflected under ResourceClaim.</description></item><item><title>Hardware Efficiency</title><link>https://dranet.dev/docs/concepts/hardware-efficiency/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2025 11:20:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dranet.dev/docs/concepts/hardware-efficiency/</guid><description>Scaling Out, Not Just Up The journey of computing has always been a quest for greater efficiency. From hypervisors carving up physical servers to containers offering even more granular control, the pattern is clear. Now, with AI/ML and High-Performance Computing (HPC) taking center stage, a new frontier in resource optimization is opening up, especially around specialized hardware like high-performance networking.
This is where solutions like DraNet, a Kubernetes network driver, are making significant strides.</description></item><item><title>RDMA</title><link>https://dranet.dev/docs/concepts/rdma/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2025 11:20:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dranet.dev/docs/concepts/rdma/</guid><description>Understanding RDMA Components in Linux RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) is a powerful technology enabling applications to directly read from or write to memory on a remote machine without involving the CPU, caches, or operating system of either machine during the data transfer. This achieves ultra-low latency and high throughput, making it ideal for high-performance computing (HPC), AI/ML, and storage.
In a Linux system, the RDMA ecosystem involves several interconnected components:</description></item><item><title>RDMA Device Handling</title><link>https://dranet.dev/docs/concepts/rdma-modes/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 May 2025 11:20:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dranet.dev/docs/concepts/rdma-modes/</guid><description>DraNet provides robust support for Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) devices, essential for high-performance computing (HPC) and AI/ML workloads that require ultra-low latency communication. DraNet&amp;rsquo;s RDMA implementation intelligently handles device allocation based on the host system&amp;rsquo;s RDMA network namespace mode.
RDMA Device Handling in DraNet DraNet manages three primary types of RDMA-related components for Pods:
RDMA Character Devices: These are user-space interfaces (e.g., /dev/infiniband/uverbsN, /dev/infiniband/rdma_cm) that user applications interact with to set up RDMA resources.</description></item><item><title>How It Works</title><link>https://dranet.dev/docs/concepts/howitworks/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2024 11:20:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dranet.dev/docs/concepts/howitworks/</guid><description>The networking DRA driver uses GRPC to communicate with the Kubelet via the DRA API and the Container Runtime via NRI. This architecture facilitates the supportability and reduces the complexity of the solution, it also makes it fully compatible and agnostic of the existing CNI plugins in the cluster.
The DRA driver, once the Pod network namespaces has been created, will receive a GRPC call from the Container Runtime via NRI to execute the corresponding configuration.</description></item><item><title>References</title><link>https://dranet.dev/docs/concepts/references/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Dec 2024 11:20:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://dranet.dev/docs/concepts/references/</guid><description> KEP 3063 - Dynamic Resource Allocation #306 KEP 3695 - DRA: structured parameters #438 Extend PodResources to include resources from Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) Working Group Device Management Kubernetes Network Drivers, Antonio Ojea, Presentation The Future of Kubernetes Networking - Antonio Ojea, Googe &amp;amp; Dan Winship, Red Hat - Kubernetes Contributor Summit EU 2024 Better Together!
